FEATURE ADDITIONS

The stats were adjusted so that each character could have both strengths and weaknesses.
A random number between -5 to 5 was added to the calculated damage to give a slight variation
	to each attack. 
Descriptions were modified to more accurately portray each Character.


CODE RESTRUCTURINGS

Originally there were objects of each character subclass existing solely to make the about method work. Now these objects can also become the playerâ€™s character, instead of invoking another constructor for pat.


HOW TO PLAY

Note, dear adventurer, that thy attack can change with luck.
For with luck thou canst gain great power! But thou shalt be more susceptible to harm.
If thou faceth a monster, that is.
All the same, fare well, dear adventurer.

Select thy difficulty level, input thy name, chooseth thy character, and go forth!
